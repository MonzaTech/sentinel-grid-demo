## 🔍 Overview
Sentinel Grid is an AI-powered early-warning and decision-support platform that monitors live telemetry, weather, and cyber data to predict and prevent infrastructure failures in sectors like power grids, telecom networks, water systems, and transportation.

This MVP demo showcases real-time simulation, anomaly detection, risk forecasting, and blockchain proofs—built for governments, utilities, and defense sectors.

## 🎯 Mission
To make the world’s critical infrastructure self-aware and self-defending.

Sentinel Grid builds an AI-driven early-warning network that detects vulnerabilities, simulates cross-sector risks, and coordinates rapid response, ensuring continuity for governments, utilities, and citizens.

---

## ❌ The Problem
Global infrastructure systems are increasingly interdependent and fragile.

Power grids, communications, water, and transportation networks are all targets for cyberattacks, natural disasters, and overload failures.

Existing solutions are siloed, leaving decision-makers blind to cross-domain risks that can cascade across sectors.

**Our World Runs on Fragile Connections:**

Power grids, telecom networks, and transport systems are increasingly interconnected — and vulnerable. Cyberattacks, weather events, and overloads trigger cascading failures that disrupt nations. Governments and utilities rely on siloed tools that react after failure, not before.

$195B economic hit from Texas 2021 freeze, preventable with 48h warning.


---

## ✅ The Solution
Sentinel Grid acts as the “NORAD of infrastructure”, a unified AI command system that provides real-time threat forecasting, cross-sector simulation, and predictive response.

Using machine learning, anomaly detection, and secure data fusion, it identifies vulnerabilities before they trigger catastrophic outages.

**AI That Predicts and Prevents Infrastructure Failure:**

Sentinel Grid fuses live telemetry, weather, and cyber data to identify vulnerabilities and forecast cascading risks. Acts as an early-warning and decision-support layer for national infrastructure. Built for dual-use deployment across government and enterprise networks.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Data Fusion Layer:** Integrates energy, cyber, and environmental feeds.  
2. **AI Prediction Engine:** Detects anomalies and simulates risk propagation.  
3. **Command Dashboard:** Delivers real-time intelligence for coordinated response.  

Predict. Prevent. Protect.

## 🔑 Core Capabilities
- **Autonomous Threat Forecasting:** Real-time AI monitoring across cyber, energy, and environmental data streams.  
- **Cross-Sector Simulation Engine:** Predicts cascading failures before they occur.  
- **Unified Command Dashboard:** Delivers operational awareness for multi-agency coordination.  
- **Secure Data Fabric:** Ensures privacy and trust across government and enterprise networks.

## 💡 Technical Overview

### 1. System Architecture  
Sentinel Grid integrates three intelligent layers designed to detect and prevent cascading failures across infrastructure networks. 

- **Data Fusion Layer:** Ingests and normalizes live telemetry from sensors, SCADA systems, and open data sources across energy, communication, and transport sectors.  
- **AI Prediction Engine:** Uses machine learning, graph analytics, and probabilistic models to identify vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and forecast cross-sector risks.  
- **Decision Interface:** A unified dashboard that delivers real-time alerts, risk visualizations, and predictive recommendations for decision-makers across agencies.  

This architecture enables cross-domain situational awareness — transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.  

### 2. Data Sources  
Sentinel Grid leverages both public and private data streams to enhance predictive accuracy:  

- Energy grid telemetry (DOE, EIA, and utility partners)  
- Weather and climate data (NOAA, NASA)  
- Cyber threat intelligence feeds (MITRE ATT&CK, OpenCTI)  
- IoT sensors and smart-city data networks  
- Decentralized networks (e.g., IPFS/Filecoin via ProbeLab) for integrity proofs  

All data is securely ingested through encrypted APIs and anonymized when shared between entities.  

### 3. Core Technologies  
- **Machine Learning:** Real-time anomaly detection and trend prediction.  
- **Graph Neural Networks:** Modeling interdependencies between systems to predict cascading effects.  
- **Federated Learning:** Secure multi-party collaboration without centralizing sensitive data.  
- **Blockchain Audit Trail:** Immutable verification of events and response logs (optional advanced module, e.g., via Aptos/Wormhole).  

### 4. Security & Compliance  
Sentinel Grid is designed for deployment in high-security environments:  

- Zero-trust architecture with multi-factor authentication  
- AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit  
- NIST SP 800-82, ISO 27001, and IEC 62443 alignment  
- Air-gapped and on-premise deployment options for defense and government networks  

### 5. MVP Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 — Prototype:** Data ingestion pipeline + anomaly detection model (3 months)  
- **Phase 2 — Platform:** Dashboard integration + multi-sector simulation engine (6 months)  
- **Phase 3 — Pilot:** Full deployment with one utility or defense partner (12 months)  

Each phase builds operational capability while validating commercial and dual-use applications. (Live MVP demo: https://sentinelgrid-demo.streamlit.app/)

### 6. Deployment Options  
- **On-Premise:** Secure installation for government or defense clients  
- **Private Cloud:** AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, or NATO-accredited cloud  
- **Hybrid:** Cross-border collaboration between allied agencies and enterprises
